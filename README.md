# About These Repos

These repos contain stuff related to the game [ΔV: Rings of Saturn by Kodera Software](https://games.kodera.pl/dv/).

Currently Available:

- [DV Annotate](NimrodXMods/dv-annotate) - a utility for collecting and packaging up diagnostic information for QA and bug reporting.

Planned:

- A "wizard" type GUI script for modding environment setup.
- Some actual game mods, like a remass-only MPU and probably other stuff once I get a better handle on modding the game.

<!--- This is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. --->
