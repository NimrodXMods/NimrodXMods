# About These Repos

These repos contain stuff related to the game [ΔV: Rings of Saturn by Kodera Software](https://games.kodera.pl/dv/).

Currently Available:

- [DV Annotate](https://github.com/NimrodXMods/dv-annotate) - a utility for collecting and packaging up diagnostic information for QA and bug reporting.

Planned:

- A "wizard" type GUI script for modding environment setup.
- Some actual game mods, like a remass-only MPU and probably other stuff once I get a better handle on modding the game.

Other Stuff:

- I wrote this guide on Steam: [The Spoiler-Free New Game Strategy Guide for ΔV: What to Buy First and 3 Steps to 1M E$ per 15 Minutes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3332050641). It is also on [the wiki](https://delta-v.kodera.pl/index.php/The_Spoiler-Free_New_Game_Strategy_Guide_for_%CE%94V:_What_to_Buy_First_and_3_Steps_to_1M_E%24_per_15_Minutes).
- Also see the [ΔV Wiki](https://delta-v.kodera.pl/index.php/Main_Page) (which I haven't contributed much to)
- I am on the [ΔV Discord](https://discord.gg/dv).
